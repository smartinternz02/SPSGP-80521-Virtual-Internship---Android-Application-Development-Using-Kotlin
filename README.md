### Build A Grocery Android App - Project 2
As we can't remember everything, users frequently forget to buy the things they want to buy. However, with the assistance of this app, you can make a list of the groceries you intend to buy so that you don't forget anything.

- Grocery App is an Android Kotlin based project done in the intension of storing the Grocery items. Sometimes we decided what to purchase from market but meanwhile forgot to buy Some things that we actually needed.
- So this app uses Room database to store the record of the Grocery so that we cant forget to buy that thing next time

## Features of GroceryListApp

- It has user friendly UI, means easy to use by any user
- It has add (+) button to add any grocery item into the list
- After hitting add (+) button the popup will ask things like item name(name of the grocery), item quantity in kg and price of one kg for that item and based on that data, the app will create one record for that item with its total cost.
- App has functionality of delete button to delete particular record from the list.
- The data store in the app is persistent i.e it will not delete items record even after app restarted(clearing app data is exception)
